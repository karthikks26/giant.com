      <h4>Giant in clash of clans</h4>
      <p>The Giant is the third troop unlocked in the Barracks. The Giantâ€™s first target is defenses, making them an ideal troop to deploy to get rid of defenses fast. However, due to their low attack damage they are better used in large groups.
        Giants prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Giants do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.
        Once all defenses are destroyed, Giants become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby and can fight back against them. However, they will not switch targets to enemy units until their previous target was destroyed.

      <h4>Giant in clash royale</h4>
      <p>The Giant is a Rare card that is unlocked from the Training Camp (Tutorial). He is a building-targeting, melee troop with very high hitpoints and moderate damage. He wears a large, brown coat made of cloth and has ginger sideburns and bushy eyebrows with blue eyes. A Giant card costs 5 Elixir to deploy.
        The Giant costs only 5 Elixir, which is very cheap considering its massive health pool. This makes it more effective in decks that rely on the counterpush to gain damage, as the Giant will be able to be deployed more quickly as a tank for these pushes.
The Giant is very effective when used as a shield for other troops due to his great Elixir to health ratio. He can soak up the damage of enemy troops while other supporting units or the Crown Towers behind the Giant deal damage to them.
